# FUTURE_CS_02 – Phishing Email Detection & Awareness System

📌 Internship Information
- Intern Name: Arra Vaishnavi Reddy  
- Domain: Cyber Security  
- Organization: Future Interns  
- Task Name : Phishing Email Detection & Awareness System  

🎯 Objective

The objective of this task is to analyze different types of email messages to identify phishing attempts, understand common phishing techniques, and create awareness about email-based cyber threats. This task aims to improve the ability to recognize malicious emails and reduce the risk of phishing attacks through proper awareness and prevention strategies.

 🛠 Tools Used
- Simulated phishing and legitimate email samples  
- Sender and domain analysis  
- Content and language inspection  
- Google Docs / MS Word for documentation  
- PDF format for final report submission  

📧 Email Samples Analyzed
- Email Types: Safe, Suspicious, and Phishing  
- Source: Simulated email samples (for educational purposes)  

> Note: All email samples used in this project are simulated for educational and awareness purposes.

🧪 Steps Performed
1. Collected simulated email samples representing different email categories  
2. Examined sender email addresses and domain names  
3. Analyzed email content for urgency, threats, and suspicious language  
4. Checked for the presence of suspicious or malicious links  
5. Classified emails as Safe, Suspicious, or Phishing  
6. Documented findings and prevention guidelines  

👀 Observations
- Legitimate emails had trusted domains and neutral language  
- Suspicious emails showed minor red flags such as domain typos and urgency  
- Phishing emails used fake domains, threatening language, and action-based requests  
- Users are often pressured to act quickly in phishing emails  

🚨 Email Analysis

1. Spoofed or Fake Sender Addresses
   
Description:  
Phishing emails often use fake or spoofed sender addresses to appear legitimate.

Impact:  
Users may trust the email and share sensitive information, leading to credential theft or financial fraud.

Mitigation:  
Verify sender domains and avoid trusting unknown or suspicious email addresses.

2. Urgent and Threatening Language
   
Description:
Phishing emails create panic by threatening account suspension or immediate consequences.

Impact:  
Users may act without verifying the email, increasing the risk of phishing success.

Mitigation: 
Encourage users to pause, verify, and avoid acting on urgent email requests.

3. Suspicious Links and Requests
   
Description:  
Phishing emails contain malicious links or requests for sensitive information.

Impact:  
Clicking such links can lead to malware infections or credential compromise.

Mitigation:  
Avoid clicking unknown links and never share sensitive information via email.

 ⚠️ Risk Severity
- Risk Level: Medium  

Justification:  
While phishing emails rely on social engineering rather than technical exploitation, their success rate is high and can cause serious damage if users are unaware or untrained.

📉 Risk Impact
- Credential theft and account compromise  
- Financial fraud and identity theft  
- Malware infections  
- Loss of organizational trust and reputation  

✅ Recommendations
- Verify sender email addresses carefully  
- Avoid clicking suspicious or unknown links  
- Never share personal or financial information via email  
- Report phishing emails to the security team  
- Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication  
- Conduct regular phishing awareness training  

🏁 Conclusion
This task demonstrates how phishing emails exploit human behavior to carry out cyber attacks. By identifying phishing indicators and promoting awareness, users can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to phishing attacks. Proper education and cautious email handling are essential components of effective cybersecurity defense.
